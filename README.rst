Although neuronal dendrites play a crucial role in shaping how individual 
neurons process synaptic information, their contribution to network-level 
functions has remained largely unexplored. Current spiking neural networks 
(SNNs) often oversimplify dendritic properties or overlook their essential 
functions. On the other hand, circuit models with morphologically detailed 
neuron representations are computationally intensive, making them impractical 
for simulating large networks.

In an effort to bridge this gap, we present Dendrifyâ€”a freely available,
open-source Python package that seamlessly integrates with the
`Brian 2 simulator <https://brian2.readthedocs.io/en/stable/>`_. Dendrify,
through simple commands, automatically generates reduced compartmental neuron
models with simplified yet biologically relevant dendritic and synaptic
integrative properties. These models offer a well-rounded compromise between
flexibility, performance, and biological accuracy, enabling us to investigate
the impact of dendrites on network-level functions.
